# Kalibrr Business Intelligence Test Solution

A repository providing my solutions to the problem sets given for business intelligence recruitment by Kalibrr
Consisted of:
- Code Solutions of Basic Programming Aptitude Test
- Marketing Activities Proposal for Business Case Test

I managed to get an offer for this solution, even though the requirements state a minimum of 1 year experience. 
But unfortunately, I was still an intern at GO-JEK for the next 3 weeks while they need a candidate immediately. 
So I declined the offer.
